A system for role-playing game story/campaign/epic management. This repository is the frontend - PHP Version.

## Background
[Role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) are a very wide category, ranging from very simplistic systems to extremely complex mechanical solutions. What they do have in common, though, is the story - you can play a game without mechanics, but even a primitive dungeon crawl is going to have some story. Managing this story, its cast, threads, and - if present - mechanical components - is the role of this project.

The project is currently split in three parts - [backend](https://github.com/mikron-ia/rpg-hub-backend) and two variants of the frontend - this and [AngularJS, undeveloped yet, version](https://github.com/mikron-ia/rpg-hub-frontend). Reason for twofold version of frontend is simple: I need a functional page ASAP, and have too little time to write AngularJS code with any decency. 

This version of frontend is being written in PHP with Silex. Data to fuel the frontend will be retrieved from API provided by backend.

## Installation guide
... will be created once the project does anything useful.
